		}
	],
	items: [

	i_list: []
}

# Currency data

1. currency, as the currency by default
2. all available currencies, with their ids, display names and most important, multipliers

{
	currency: 1,
	currencies: [

		}
	],	
}

# Currency logic

Users ballance and machine balance values are stored as number, which can be converted to resective currency by multiplying to its multiplication number.
